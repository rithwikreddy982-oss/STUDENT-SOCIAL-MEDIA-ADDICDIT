# STUDENT-SOCIAL-MEDIA-ADDICDIT
"Analyzed student social media addiction using survey data to identify usage patterns, screen time habits, and behavioral impacts. Applied statistical analysis and visualization to uncover key factors influencing addiction and provide insights for awareness and prevention.
This project explores the impact of social media usage on students and identifies the factors contributing to addiction-like behavior. The study analyzes how platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok influence students’ academic performance, mental well-being, productivity, and daily routines.

The project involves collecting data through surveys, questionnaires, or online datasets focused on usage patterns, screen time, preferred platforms, emotional responses, and academic outcomes. After preparing and cleaning the data, statistical analysis is performed to identify correlations between social media usage and signs of addiction—including lack of concentration, reduced sleep, mood changes, and dependency.

Using data visualization tools, the findings are presented through charts and graphs that highlight key trends such as peak usage hours, behavioral indicators, and the relationship between social media habits and academic performance. The study also compares addiction levels across different age groups, genders, and academic backgrounds to understand broader patterns.

Machine learning or clustering techniques can be applied to group students based on their usage intensity and classify addiction levels (low, moderate, or high). Insights from this analysis help in suggesting preventive measures such as digital detox, time-management strategies, and awareness programs to reduce unhealthy screen time.

The project concludes by emphasizing the importance of balanced social media use and provides actionable recommendations for students, parents, and educators to promote healthier digital habits.
